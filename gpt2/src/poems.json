The endless strife,","The discord in the harmonies of life!","The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,","And all the sweet serenity of books;","The market-place, the eager love of gain,","Whose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain!","But why, you ask me, should this tale be told","To men grown old, or who are growing old?","It is too late! Ah, nothing is too late","Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.","Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles","Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides","Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers,","When each had numbered more than fourscore years,","And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,","Had but begun his \"Characters of Men.\"","Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,","At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;","Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,","Completed Faust when eighty years were past.","These are indeed exceptions; but they show","How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow","Into the arctic regions of our lives,","Where little else than life itself survives.","As the barometer foretells the storm","While still the skies are clear, the weather warm","So something in us, as old age draws near,","Betrays the pressure of the atmosphere.","The nimble mercury, ere we are aware,","Descends the elastic ladder of the air;","The telltale blood in artery and vein","Sinks from its higher levels in the brain;","Whatever poet, orator, or sage","May say of it, old age is still old age.","It is the waning, not the crescent moon;","The dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon;","It is not strength, but weakness; not desire,","But its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire,","The burning and consuming element,","But that of ashes and of embers spent,","In which some living sparks we still discern,","Enough to warm, but not enough to burn.","What then? Shall we sit idly down and say","The night hath come; it is no longer day?","The night hath not yet come; we are not quite","Cut off from labor by the failing light;","Something remains for us to do or dare;","Even the oldest tree some fruit may bear;","Not Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek Ode,","Or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode","Out of the gateway of the Tabard Inn,","But other something, would we but begin;","For age is opportunity no less","Than youth itself, though in another dress,","And as the evening twilight fades away","The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day."]},"c723225852d1d13efd1b455f7941d800":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43294/a-dialogue-of-self-and-soul","title":"A Dialogue of Self and Soul","author":"William Butler

by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs,","Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,","There stands a structure of majestic frame,","Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.","Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom","Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home;","Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,","Dost sometimes counsel take-and sometimes tea.","Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,","To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;","In various talk th' instructive hours they pass'd,","Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;","One speaks the glory of the British queen,","And one describes a charming Indian screen;","A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;","At ev'ry word a reputation dies.","Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,","With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.","Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,","The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;","The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,","And wretches hang that jury-men may dine;","The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,","And the long labours of the toilet cease.","Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,","Burns to encounter two adventrous knights,","At ombre singly to decide their doom;","And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.","Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,","Each band the number of the sacred nine.","Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aerial guard","Descend, and sit on each important card:","First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,","Then each, according to the rank they bore;","For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,","Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.","Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd,","With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;","And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r,","Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;","Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,","Caps on their heads, and halberds in their hand;","And parti-colour'd troops, a shining train,","Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.","The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:","\"Let Spades be trumps!\" she said, and trumps they were.","Now move to war her sable Matadores,","In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.","Spadillio first, unconquerable lord!","Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.","As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,","And march'd a victor from the verdant field.","Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard","Gain'd but one trump and one plebeian card.","With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,","The hoary Majesty of Spades appears;","Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd;","The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.","The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,","Proves the just victim of his royal rage.","Ev'n mighty Pam, that kings and queens o'erthrew","And mow'd down armies in the fights of loo,","Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,","Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade!","Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;","Now to the baron fate inclines the field.","His warlike Amazon her host invades,","Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades.","The Club's black tyrant first her victim died,","Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride:","What boots the regal circle on his head,","His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;","That long behind he trails his pompous robe,","And of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?","The baron now his diamonds pours apace;","Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face,","And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd","Of broken troops an easy conquest find.","Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,","With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.","Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs,","Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,","With like confusion diff'rent nations fly,","Of various habit, and of various dye,","The pierc'd battalions disunited fall.","In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.","The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,","And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.","At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,","A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;","She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill,","Just in the jaws of ruin, and codille.","And now (as oft in some distemper'd state)","On one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate.","An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen","Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:","He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,","And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.","The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;","The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.","Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,","Too soon dejected, and too soon elate!","Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away,","And curs'd for ever this victorious day.","For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,","The berries crackle, and the mill turns round.","On shining altars of Japan they raise","The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze.","From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,","While China's earth receives the smoking tide.","At once they gratify their scent and taste,","And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.","Straight hover round the fair her airy band;","Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,","Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,","Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.","Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,","And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)","Sent up in vapours to the baron's brain","New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.","Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere 'tis too late,","Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!","Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air,","She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair!","But when to mischief mortals bend their will,","How soon they find fit instruments of ill!","Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace","A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case;","So ladies in romance assist their knight","Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.","He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends","The little engine on his fingers' ends;","This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,","As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.","Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,","A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair,","And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear,","Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.","Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought","The close recesses of the virgin's thought;","As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd,","He watch'd th' ideas rising in her mind,","Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,","An earthly lover lurking at her heart.","Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd,","Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd.","The peer now spreads the glitt'ring forfex wide,","T' inclose the lock; now joins it, to divide.","Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd,","A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd;","Fate urg'd the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,","(But airy substance soon unites again).","The meeting points the sacred hair dissever","From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!","Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,","And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.","Not louder shrieks to pitying Heav'n are cast,","When husbands or when lap-dogs breathe their last,","Or when rich China vessels, fall'n from high,","In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie!","\"Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,\"","The victor cried, \"the glorious prize is mine!","While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,","Or in a coach and six the British fair,","As long at","Atalantis","shall be read,","Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,","While visits shall be paid on solemn days,","When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,","While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,","So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!","What time would spare, from steel receives its date,","And monuments, like men, submit to fate!","Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,","And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy;","Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,","And hew triumphal arches to the ground.","What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel","The conqu'ring force of unresisted

open pages","were pocked and dotted with solid O's, like villages","and capitals on a map.

Heaven knows how many","he had so far filled, but no matter, there still were","uncountable volumes of O-laden prose, and odes","with inflated capital O's (in the manner of Shelley),","O-bearing Bibles and biographies,","even whole sections devoted to O alone,","all his for the filling.  Glory, glory, glory!","How lovely and open and endless the world must have seemed to him,","how utterly clear-cut!  Think of it.  A pencil","was all he needed.  Life was one wide O.","Anyway, why in the end should O's not be closed","as eyes are?  I envied him.  After all,","sitting across from him, had I accomplished","anything as firm as he had, or as fruitful?","What could I show?  a handful of scrawled lines,","and afternoon yawned and wondered away,","and a growing realization that in time","even my scribbled words would come","under his grubby thumb, and the blinds be drawn","on all my O's.
